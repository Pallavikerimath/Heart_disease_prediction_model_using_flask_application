# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction Model using Flask Application 

## 📘 Overview
The **Heart Disease Prediction Model** is a web application built with **Flask** and **Machine Learning**.  
It predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs such as **age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level**, and other medical parameters.  
This project demonstrates how **AI and data science** can support **predictive healthcare** and early risk detection.
